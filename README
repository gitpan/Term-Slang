PATCHES
-------

Please send me patches!

A word about Style:

I am picky.

Please use diff -ur

Use tabs (8) to indent all blocks.

Use ) {, not ){

Don't use () if you don't have to.

Defaults are good.

Spaces and newlines are good.

Thank you. This has been a public service announcment of the anal-retentive.
